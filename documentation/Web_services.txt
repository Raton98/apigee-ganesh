Web Services
-----------
-> makes application resources available over networks 
-> based on standard interfaces, OS independant(cross platform), multi lingual support
-> Asynchronous functionality
-> application components, communicate using open protocols
-> self contained and self describing
-> can be discovered using UDDI(Universal description, discovery and integration)

History of web-services
-----------------------
-> evolved from RPC(Remote procedure call) mechanism in DCE(Distributed computing environment)
-> Early 1990s DCE includes distributed file system(DCE/DFS) and kerberos-based authentication system
-> DCE has its origins from Unix world, Microsoft did its implementation MSRPC, for interprocess communication in windows
-> Microsoft's COM/OLE(Common Object Model/Object Linking and embedding) technologies are build on DCE/RPE foundation
-> DCE designed RPC to do distributed computing(computing across distinct physical devices), Microsoft cleverly adapted RPC to support interprocess communication
   in the form of COM infrastructure, on a single device, a PC running windows
-> 1st gen frameworks for distributed object systems, CORBA(common object request broker architecture) and Microsoft's DCOM(Distibuted COM), are anchored in DCE/RPC procedural framework.
-> Java RMI (Remote method invocation) also derives from DCE/PRC, and the method calls in Java EE(Enterprise Edition), specifically in Session and Entity EJBs(Enterprise Java Edition) are Java RMI calls.
-> Java EE(Formerly J2EE) and Microsoft .Net are 2nd gen frameworks for Distributed objecct systems
-> Samba file and print service for windows clients utilities still use DCE/RPC

1st Gen Distributed object systems -> CORBA and DCOM
2nd Gen Distributed object systems -> Java EE and Microsoft .Net 



Network protocols
-----------------

Things to check
---------------


1. WSDL, XML based SOAP, RDF, RSS

WSDL: Web services description language, used to describe web services and written in XML, contain tags to define a web service
-> port type, can be used to define the operations performed and messages that are involved.
	one-way(SET); request-response(GET); solicit-response; notification

-> binding can be done to SOAP service, using soap:binding


SOAP : Simple Object Access protocol
-> XML based protocol for accessing web services


RDF: Resource description framewirk
-> Describing resources on the web, written in xml

RSS: Really simple syndication
-> syndicate your site content, easy way to share and view headlines and content
-> RSS files can ne automatically updated
