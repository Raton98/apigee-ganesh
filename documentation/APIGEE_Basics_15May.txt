Why APIGEE?
What is APIGEE?

What 
API Management tool 
Expose our API to internet -> managed by someone 

Platform -> create proxies 
interface between client and service

in UP we do consume rest services from angular client 

APIGEE -> puts a proxy between client(Android, IOS, Angular, any mobile device)
-> rather than client consuming API we have proxy to consume services
-> adding proxy can have securiy, rate limiting, caching, analytics 
-> cors issues(cross origin -> angular is deployed in another server and java runs on another server, 
browser has policies and request coming from client should be given @Cors in spring)
Required headers for each request to tell that this is a valid request to be accepted
Take boiler plate code and should be told to acccept by domain -> can be avoided by proxy
-> APIGEE gives cors policies or proxy
-> APIGEE provides security -> @Security in web service in 
   rate limiting -> thousands of requests to exposed api , rest api to provide info about some requirement
   lets say if we get 2 lakh requests and service is down 
-> APIGEE can limit the number of requests 
   product containing of multiple quota policies 
   APIs -> exposed over internet -> sell product to different clients -> 1000 requests charge is decided and beyond that threshold that is different
  -> for different client we have different pricing 
  -> create products -> 2 different products for 2 different companies -> quota policies -> measure requests and price them accordingly
-> APIGEE have quota policies
-> APIGEE have caching(static data can be cached), perisistence(persist data) and BaaS(BAckend as a service)
   client -> comes to proxy -> it hits proxy and get resposne from cache and give it back 
-> APIGEE used to analyse the requests for API
   transformation -> clients consume json -> most use restful web services 
   legacy -> newest tech -> how much revenue to be invested for this transformation   
   soap -> rest -> policy can be used to convert xml to json (we can expose our restful web services)
-> APIGEE can be used in transformation

URI should be designed in a proper format -> API design in REST APi can be done in a better way
